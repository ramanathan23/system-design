## 2. [**Database Technologies**](./database-technologies.md)

   - Explore modern database technologies, including NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra) and NewSQL databases (e.g., CockroachDB).
   - Master data modeling and schema design for distributed databases.

## 3. [**Scalability and Performance**](./scalability-and-performance.md)

   - Understand horizontal scaling, auto-scaling, and load balancing techniques for modern cloud-native applications.
   - Learn about performance monitoring and optimization in microservices architectures.

## 4. [**Cloud-Native Services**](./cloud-native-services.md)

   - Familiarize yourself with cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.
   - Learn about managed services like AWS Lambda, AWS Fargate, and Azure Functions.

## 5. [**Security in Modern Systems**](./security-in-modern-systems.md)

   - Explore security best practices for cloud-native applications, including identity and access management (IAM) and encryption.
   - Understand container security and continuous security monitoring.

## 6. [**API Design and GraphQL**](./api-design-and-graphql.md)

   - Master RESTful API design principles.
   - Explore GraphQL as an alternative API design approach and understand its benefits and use cases.

## 7. [**Real-Time Communication**](./real-time-communication.md)

   - Understand how to implement real-time features in microservices architectures.

## 8. [**Streaming Data Processing**](./stream-data-processing.md)

   - Study stream processing frameworks like Apache Kafka and Apache Flink.
   - Learn how to build real-time data pipelines for analytics and event-driven applications.

## 9. [**Machine Learning Integration**](./machine-learning-integration.md)

   - Familiarize yourself with machine learning models and frameworks.
   - Explore how to integrate machine learning into your system design for recommendation engines and predictive analytics.

## 10. [**Serverless Computing**](./serverless-computing.md)

   - Understand the concepts of serverless computing and its advantages.
   - Learn how to design and deploy serverless applications using platforms like AWS Lambda and Azure Functions.

## 11. [**Monitoring and Observability**](./monitoring-observability.md)

   - Explore monitoring and observability tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and Jaeger.
   - Learn how to set up dashboards and alerts for proactive system management.

## 12. [**Chaos Engineering**](./chaos-engineering.md)

   - Study the principles of chaos engineering and how to perform chaos experiments.
   - Understand how chaos engineering can improve system resilience.

## 13. [**Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD)**](./ci-cd.md)

   - Master CI/CD pipelines using tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or AWS CodePipeline.
   - Learn about GitOps and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for automated infrastructure management.

## 14. **Stay Updated and Experiment**

   - Stay current with emerging technologies by following tech blogs, attending conferences, and participating in online communities.
   - Continuously experiment with new tools and frameworks to broaden your expertise.
